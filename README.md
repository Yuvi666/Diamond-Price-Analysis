# Diamond-Price-Analysis
Problem Statement:
The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate diamond prices using features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions (x, y, z).
Data Description

The dataset contains these columns:
price: Price in US dollars, ranging from $326 to $18,823.
carat: Weight of the diamond, from 0.2 to 5.01.
cut: Quality of the diamond cut (categories: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
color: Diamond color, graded from J (worst) to D (best).
clarity: Clarity level, from I1 (worst) to IF (best).
x, y, z: Dimensions of the diamond in millimeters (length, width, and depth).
depth: Total depth percentage, calculated as 
z/mean(x,Â y).
table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
